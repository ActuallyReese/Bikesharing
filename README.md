# Bikesharing 

### [Link to dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/reese.coulter "link to dashboard")

## Overview
The purpose of the analysis is to convince hypothetical investors that Des Moines would benefit from a bike-sharing company like the one in New York called Citibike.

## Results

### ![Customers_Type_Gender](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40220871/151642412-1b5d39f1-a957-4f9f-937d-fefe5eed86ad.png)
As can be seen here, most subscribers are male. As for non-subscribers, a majority of them do not have a known gender, so the data is likely to be more unreliable when it comes to gender trends. However, overall, most of the users are subscribers.

### ![Trips_Weekday_Hour](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40220871/151644120-62a81060-0639-4f18-8031-33cbd81cc635.png)
As seen here (the actual Tableau lets you filter), most people use the bike sharing service before and after working hours or on the weekends. Subscribers are more likely to use the service during the weekdays, while non-subscribers are more likely to use them on the weekends. The chart to the right shows the peak usage hours in August, also showing the a majority of the users prefer to use the service before 9AM and after 4PM.

### ![Gender_Weekday_Hour](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40220871/151644247-90075a70-5f53-45d7-8ed2-54515bbff627.png)
This picture shows that the genders share similar use trends.

### ![Checkout_Times](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40220871/151644308-78c28d4e-45a0-43e4-bfe9-8818010bc2a0.png)
This graph shows how long users spend riding their bikes. Most users, regardless of gender, spend about 5 minutes riding the bikes. While some users do spend a few hours with the bikes, the amount of users still riding after 40 minutes is negligible.


## Summary
Overall, the usage in New York shows that there is demand for a bike sharing service. Des Moines would benefit from the service in similar ways to New York. The service is popular enough that most users are paying the subscription fee. With the given dataset, I would create visualizations comparing time of day and age to determine if a differently aged population would be as successful as New York. I might also make a graph showing the usage of the service over a year rather than just in August.
